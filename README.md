### 🖼 Description

Modern-Office-Night is a GTK theme for Linux Mint (Cinnamon edition), based on the official **Mint-Y-Dark-Aqua** theme. The goal was to create a more unified, clean, and modern look, while preserving Mint's usability and compatibility. Designed with users transitioning from popular commercial operating systems in mind, Modern Office Day offers a familiar and intuitive layout reminiscent of modern desktops. The interface is clean and neutral, providing a comfortable and professional look suitable for long hours of use, without color tints that distract from your workflow.

To complete the visual experience, it's highly recommended to use it together with the **Modern-Office-Night-Icons** icon set:

**Please note:** due to Cinnamon limitations, the theme includes separate versions for standard and scaled UI (e.g. if you are using 4K and 200% scaling) to ensure that the panel decorations (the indicators under open application icons) display correctly and consistently.
